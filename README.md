🧠 CODEXINTERN Python & Data Science Projects

This repository contains three major Python projects developed during the CODEXINTERN Internship Program, showcasing applications of data analysis, machine learning, and matrix computation.

📘 Project Overview
🧩 Task 1: Data Analysis & Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib

Objective:
To perform basic data analysis on a CSV dataset using Pandas and visualize insights using Matplotlib.

Key Features:

Load and explore CSV data using Pandas.

Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, mode, etc.).

Calculate the average of a selected column.

Create multiple visualizations:

📊 Bar Charts

🔵 Scatter Plots

🔥 Heatmaps

Generate insights and observations from data patterns and correlations.

Libraries Used:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn (optional for enhanced heatmaps)

Insights Example:

Found correlations between key variables.

Identified trends using visual analysis.

Observed outliers through scatter plots and heatmaps.

🏠 Task 2: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Objective:
To build a Linear Regression Model that predicts house prices based on features such as the number of rooms, location, and size.

Steps Involved:

Dataset Collection:

Sourced from Kaggle (Housing Price Dataset).

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Normalized and split data into training and testing sets.

Model Building:

Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated using R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Prediction:

Model predicts prices based on new user input (number of rooms, size, etc.).

Libraries Used:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

Outcome:

Achieved accurate predictions with minimal error.

Visualized the regression line and prediction performance.

🔢 Task 3: Matrix Operations Tool using NumPy

Objective:
To develop a Matrix Operations Tool that allows users to perform common matrix operations interactively using NumPy.

Features:

Input two matrices from the user.

Perform the following operations:

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

🔁 Transpose

📐 Determinant Calculation

Display results in a clean, formatted output.

Libraries Used:

numpy

Highlights:

Interactive user input system.

Error handling for invalid operations.

Real-time computation and formatted results.
